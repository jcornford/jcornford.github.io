subtitle: Plotting lines of best-fit using python

### You need to make clear that biologists don't do least squares etc as part of their degree. Wack in the bout me too.

Fitting a line of best-fit **is an example of Machine Learning**. It is also considered by many to be a basic thing 
that you can just "do" when plotting data - a problem I lay firmly at Excel's feet. It's not basic or simple, and shouldn't be
considered so. However, as a first year graduate student, newly pythonised and late to make figures for a lab presentation,
 this didn't matter to me. I just wanted to have graphs with nice lines...
 
So this first post is for the me of four years ago, with two aims:

1. Give some simple code to make some lines
2. Spark an interest and understanding of why **aim 1.** just isn't a good idea


## Give me a straight line already:

The easiest way to get yourself a line is with numpy's polyfit function:

```python

def give_me_a_straight_line(x,y):
    y = np.polyfit(x, deg=1) # not going to be correct code
    return y
    
```

There: if all you wanted was the code for a straight line through your data, you should be all set. However, I don't like this
approach (anymore), as it doesn't help you understand what's actually happening. Really, what you are doing is
fitting a function of the form:

$$ y = mx + c $$

\\[ y = mx + c2 \\]

Shit, need to get mathjax working...And blah blah, it is nice to code this directly... here:

```bash

def give_me_a_straight_line(x,y):
    y = np.polyfit(x, deg=1) # not going to be correct code
    return y
    
```

## Give me a line that goes nicely through my points:
**Sigh**. I'm firmly a member of the camp of "your-line-reflects-your-hypothesis-on-the-data-generating-process". Ie.
 **don't** just line to go through all your datapoints, (like the default **abomination in excel**) unless you think the underlying relationship 
 between x and y is truely of that nature. If in doubt use a straight line, or let the datapoints speak for themselves.
 
 However, if you insist:
 
```python

def give_me_a_nice_line(x,y):
    y = np.polyfit(x, deg=1) # not going to be correct code
    return y
    
```

What's going on here?
