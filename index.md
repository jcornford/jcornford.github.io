## Welcome to my home page!
I'm Jonathan, a final year neuroscience PhD student at Queen Square, UCL. I'm interested in how single neurons work!, and machine learning.
After a few blogs on some basics, I intend to get into using spiking neural networks to solve machine learning problems. 

## Why this website?
My background is Biology, specifically Physiological Sciences (or Medicine without the troublesome people), and I found when reading articles on machine learning
 and data-science that quite often the reader is assumed to have done Physics or Engineering at undergraduate level. That's fine, but it just takes longer to
 understand what is going on...

So, this [blog](/blog.html) is primarily aimed at Biologists, who have done a limited amount of maths, but have experience coding in python.
I'll try to use coding to inform the maths, as maths really started making more sense to me when thinking in terms of code.
