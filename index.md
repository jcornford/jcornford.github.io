## Welcome to my home page!
I'm Jonathan, a final year neuroscience PhD student at Queen Square, UCL. London. I'm interested in how single neurons work, and machine learning.
After a few blog posts, eventually I intend to have a play with using **spiking** neural networks to solve machine learning problems.
 
 

## Why this website?
My background is Biology, specifically Physiological Sciences (or Medicine without the troublesome people), and I found when reading articles on machine learning
 and data-science that quite often the reader is assumed to have done Physics or Engineering. Alternatively, things might be laser-focused on the concepts
  or implementation details, which can be really great, e.g. [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), but I often
 wished for more details, but again, without assuming prior familiarity all of the maths ([Elements of Statisitical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
 is a pretty big step up :] ). 
 
 
So, this [blog](/blog) is intended to cross that bridge, primarily aimed at Biologists, who have done a limited amount of maths, but have experience coding in python.
I'll try to use coding to inform the maths, as maths really started making more sense to me when thinking in terms of code.
